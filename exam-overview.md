Author and manage workflows (20–25%)
Configure workflow triggers and events
Configure workflows to run for scheduled, manual, webhook, and repository events

Choose appropriate scope, permissions, and events for workflow automation

Define and validate workflow_dispatch inputs (types, required, defaults) and pass inputs to reusable workflows via workflow_call with inputs and secrets mapping

Design and implement workflow structure
Use jobs, steps, and conditional logic

Implement dependencies between jobs

Use workflow commands and environment variables

Use service containers (services:) for dependent services (databases, queues); configure ports, health checks, and container options

Use strategy and matrix to generate job variations (OS, language/runtime versions); apply include/exclude; control fail-fast and max-parallel; optimize matrix size for cost and performance; account for runner image changes (Ubuntu 20.04 deprecation, Windows Server 2025 migration for windows-latest)

Implement YAML anchors and aliases (&, \* and merge <<) to reuse repeated mappings/steps within a single workflow file

Use predefined contexts (github, runner, env, vars, secrets, inputs, matrix, needs, strategy, job, steps, github.event, github.ref) to access workflow, repository, and runtime metadata; understand immutable actions behavior and version pinning requirements

Evaluate expressions with ${{ }} referencing contexts; distinguish static (workflow parse) vs runtime evaluation; prevent secret leakage in logs and expressions

Leverage editor tooling (GitHub Actions VS Code extension / YAML schema completion, metadata IntelliSense, validation) to author and maintain workflows efficiently

Manage workflow execution and outputs
Configure caching and artifact management; apply retention policies via REST APIs (logs, artifacts, workflow runs) at org/repo level

Pass data between jobs and steps (artifacts, outputs, environment files via GITHUB_ENV and GITHUB_OUTPUT, reusable workflow outputs)

Generate job summaries using GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY for rich Markdown reports (test results, coverage, links)

Add workflow status badges and environment protections

Consume and troubleshoot workflows (15–20%)
Interpret workflow behavior and results
Identify workflow triggers and effects from configuration and logs

Diagnose failed workflow runs using logs and run history

Expand and interpret YAML anchors, aliases, and merged mappings when analyzing workflow configuration

Interpret matrix expansions, correlate job names to matrix axes, analyze failures across variants, and selectively rerun individual matrix jobs

Access workflow artifacts and logs
Locate workflows, logs, and artifacts in the UI and via API

Download and manage workflow artifacts

Use and manage workflow templates
Consume organization-level and reusable workflows

Consume non-public organization workflow templates

Use starter workflows (public and private/non-public templates); customize and adapt; distinguish from reusable workflows and composite actions

Differentiate starter workflows (copy scaffold, independent after creation) vs reusable workflows (central versioned definition invoked via workflow_call) vs composite actions (encapsulated step logic)

Contrast disabling and deleting workflows

Author and maintain actions (15–20%)
Create and troubleshoot custom actions
Identify and implement action types (JavaScript, Docker, composite); understand immutable actions rollout on hosted runners and implications for version pinning and registry sources

Troubleshoot action execution and errors

Define action structure and metadata
Specify required files, directory structure, and metadata

Implement workflow commands within actions

Distribute and maintain actions
Select distribution models (public, private, marketplace)

Publish actions to the GitHub Marketplace

Apply versioning and release strategies

Manage GitHub Actions for the enterprise (20–25%)
Distribute and govern actions and workflows
Define and manage reusable components and templates

Control access to actions and workflows within the enterprise

Configure organizational use policies

Manage runners at scale
Configure and monitor GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners

Apply IP allow lists and networking settings

Manage runner groups and troubleshoot runner issues

Identify preinstalled software/tool versions on GitHub-hosted runners (image release notes, toolcache) and install additional software at runtime (setup-\* actions, package managers, caching, container images, custom self-hosted images)

Manage encrypted secrets and variables
Define and scope encrypted secrets and variables at the organization, repository, and environment levels

Access and use secrets and variables in workflows and actions; manage secrets and variables programmatically via REST APIs

Secure and optimize automation (10–15%)
Implement security best practices
Use environment protections and approval gates

Identify and use trustworthy actions from the Marketplace

Mitigate script injection (sanitize/validate inputs, least-privilege permissions, avoid untrusted data in run:, proper shell quoting, prefer vetted actions over inline scripts)

Understand GITHUB_TOKEN lifecycle (ephemeral, scoped), configure granular permissions, contrast with PAT; restrict write scopes

Use OIDC token (id-token permission) for cloud provider federation to eliminate long-lived cloud secrets

Pin third-party actions to full commit SHAs; align with immutable actions enforcement on hosted runners; avoid floating @main/@v\* without justification

Enforce action usage policies (organization/repository allow/deny lists, required reviewers for unverified actions)

Generate and verify artifact attestations / provenance (e.g., SLSA, build metadata) and integrate into deployment verification

Optimize workflow performance and cost
Configure caching and artifact retention for efficiency; apply retention policies programmatically via REST APIs

Recommend strategies for scaling and optimizing workflows
